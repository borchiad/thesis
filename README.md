# thesis

Mathematica notebooks, files and material.

## Scope

The repository keeps trace of the work on the various notebooks used in the refinement of the model describing the SQUISET NEST1 7.

## Content

The file rates_balance.nb is the latest and more complete notebook, containing both a section dedicated to the computation/import of the tunneling rates, the following interpolation on a 3D flux/energy/temperature mesh and their use in the charge-heat balance equation (yet to be coded).

The folder to_send contains the exploded files working on a reduced part of the temperature sampling, to be sent to various computers for evaluation. Four subfolders specify the element (right or left) and the type of rates (charge, thermal) in analysis.
